# üí≠ Intuition
Constraints are allowing the algorithm to be $O(NlogN)$, which helps use to find the answer using _binary search_. The answer is between 1 to _total energy of batteries divided by number of computers_. <br/>
For a chosen amount of time, we check if we can extract enough energy from batteries, such that it can run `n` computers for enough time.

<hr/>

# üìù Approach
- `mn` is the starting point, and `mx` is the ending point of search.
    - `mn = 1`, because there is always enough batteries to run `n` computers for atleast 1 minute.
    - `mx = totalRuntime / n`, considering the best case where least energy is lost.
- `mn` is current answer, the loop is running to find a higher runtime. So we will run the loop until there is chance to make the answer higher (`mn < mx`).
- We will take `ceil` value of average of `mn` and `mx` as `mid`. Because We want to make next answer (`mid`) greater than current answer (`mn`). Otherwise the loop would stuck in infinite repeatations.
- `canRun` function checks if `n` computers can be run for `mid` minutes with `batteries`. If returned value is true then we set `mn = mid` and continue the search further.
- Otherwise set `mx = mid-1`, since it is now confirmed that `n` computers can't run for more than `mid-1` minutes.
- Return `mn` after the loop breaks.

#### `canRun` function :
- takes `batteries`_(energy of every battery)_, `computers`_(total number of computers)_ and `time`_(runtime of computers)_ as parameters.
- two local variables :
    - `energyRequired`: total energy `n` computers will need to run for `time` minutes. $[energyRequired = n * time]$
    - `energyAvailable`: maximum energy `batteries` can supply for `time` minutes. $[energyAvailable = \sum_{i=0}^{b-1}min(batteries_i,time)|where,b=batteries.size()]$
- Returns `true` if `energyRequired` is within `energyAvailable`, else returns `false`.

        while(mn < mx) {
            long long mid = mn + (mx-mn+1)/2; // add 1 to avoid inf loop
            if(canRun(batteries, n, mid)) mn = mid; // improved ans

        }   return mn;
